# Host support and qualification

The required native development and operator hosts are Ubuntu 24.04 x86-64
and macOS 15 on Apple Silicon (ARM64) and Intel (x86-64). The crate's canister
runtime target remains `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Windows host workflows are
not qualified.

| Host | CI runner | Native qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu 24.04 x86-64 | `ubuntu-24.04` | Portable tooling and PocketIC ownership tests |
| macOS 15 ARM64 | `macos-15` | Portable tooling and PocketIC ownership tests |
| macOS 15 x86-64 | `macos-15-intel` | Portable tooling and PocketIC ownership tests |

Runner labels and architectures follow the [GitHub runner inventory](https://github.com/actions/runner-images#available-images).
The matrix declares required support; each revision needs a successful matching
native workflow run. Linux checks do not qualify macOS behavior. The complete
CI, MSRV, archive verification and publish dry-run gates are configured on all
three native hosts. Native macOS qualification remains pending until matching
workflow runs pass. Do not publish or push
just to qualify tooling.

At `v0.16.0` (`5f4a850b6dc3bb5652418f85dd18ed97f63046ce`), the native
Linux gate and PocketIC concurrency checks passed, but macOS startup and
filesystem fixtures failed. See the [ARM64 startup failure](https://github.com/dragginzgame/ic-testkit/actions/runs/37317725235/job/111788601271),
[Intel startup failure](https://github.com/dragginzgame/ic-testkit/actions/runs/37317725777/job/111788604408),
and [ARM64 full-gate results](https://github.com/dragginzgame/ic-testkit/actions/runs/37317725235/job/111788601582).
These earlier runs are failure evidence, not macOS qualification for a changed
revision.

At `v0.16.1` (`e06093f9a3169383ba66ab734d36718975d7ff0c`), the
[native workflow](https://github.com/dragginzgame/ic-testkit/actions/runs/37323482068)
passed the complete gates, MSRV and concurrency checks on all three hosts,
and portable-host checks on Linux and ARM64 macOS. The
[Intel portable-host job](https://github.com/dragginzgame/ic-testkit/actions/runs/37323482068/job/111808187977)
failed because the background-reaper fixture exited before startup observed
its published port. The current test uses an explicit release after reaper
handoff; it and the new benchmark driver require fresh native CI confirmation.

## Prerequisites

- Bash 3.2 or newer. On macOS, use `/bin/bash` to exercise the system shell.
- GNU Make (the macOS system Make is sufficient), Git, Perl, and standard Unix
  tools including `awk`, `cat`, `find`, `grep`, `mkfifo`, `mktemp`, `ps`, `sed`,
  `sort` and `tar`. Managed process tests use `/bin/ps -p <pid> -o stat=` on both
  native Unix hosts to distinguish running processes, zombies and reaped children.
- A SHA-256 implementation: Linux `sha256sum` or macOS `shasum -a 256`.
- Rustup with the repository's pinned toolchain, `rustfmt`, `clippy`, and the
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target. Published MSRV checks use Rust 1.88.
- `cloc` and `jq` for `make cloc`. These are optional for builds; install them
  using the host's package manager before requesting a LOC report.
- Live PocketIC tests require a compatible native PocketIC 16 binary. Set
  `POCKET_IC_BIN` to its exact local path to avoid upstream automatic download.
  Managed startup takes an explicit caller-provided binary and owns its child.
- The opt-in fixture-reuse benchmark requires the repository's probe canister,
  prepared Cargo caches, and `uname`. Its Linux RSS sampler reads native `/proc`;
  macOS uses the system `/bin/ps` process-leader RSS in KiB. The benchmark records
  its sampling source and does not download a server or dependency upgrades.
- Publishing additionally requires Cargo registry credentials. Mocked release
  and publish guard checks do not use credentials or perform remote writes.

Release CI runs `make ci` with the caller's temporary-directory environment.
It preserves Cargo artifacts and does not remove temporary files underneath
upstream background servers. Managed server handles own their process cleanup.

## Focused qualification

Run these commands sequentially, with no other validation modifying their
inputs. The shell guards use fixtures and mock external commands:

```bash
/bin/bash scripts/ci/verify-shared-tooling-snapshot.sh
/bin/bash scripts/ci/check-release-guards.sh
/bin/bash scripts/ci/check-publish-guards.sh
/bin/bash scripts/ci/check-github-actions-pinned.sh
cargo fetch --locked
cargo test -p ic-testkit --locked --offline --lib pic::startup::tests
cargo test -p ic-testkit --locked --offline --example fixture_reuse_benchmark_driver
cargo test -p ic-testkit --locked --offline --test pocket_ic_concurrency
```

Fetching is an explicit preparation step and preserves the selected lockfile.
For an already prepared offline host, use `cargo fetch --locked --offline`;
missing cache data is a preparation failure, not permission to select upgrades.
The focused startup tests use synthetic servers; the caller-provided live
server test is ignored unless explicitly selected as described in the README.
Process ownership checks cover leader reaping and descendant termination on
handle drop, readiness timeout, natural exit and background reaping on both
Linux and macOS.
The driver checks include native process observations, report bounds and
subprocess completion on interruption. They use synthetic workers rather than
running the live benchmark. Passing Linux checks does not qualify macOS; the
new driver still needs native ARM64 and Intel CI confirmation.

The `portable-hosts` and `pocket-ic-concurrency` workflow jobs exercise the
declared native hosts. For LOC tooling after installing its prerequisites:

```bash
/bin/bash scripts/dev/cloc.sh
```

The maintainer owns full pre-push, release and publication gates. Agents run
only checks affected by their authorized changes.
